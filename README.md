# Wallet Balance Checker

This service periodically checks the balance of specified Ethereum wallets and sends alerts to a Slack channel if the balance falls below a defined threshold. The service is built with Go and can be run inside a Docker container.

## Features

- Periodically checks Ethereum wallet balances.
- Sends alerts to a Slack channel if the balance is below the threshold.
- Configurable via a YAML file.
- Runs as a Docker container.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Go 1.22.4 (if running locally)

## Configuration

Create a `config.yaml` file with the following structure:

```yaml
slackWebhook: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/your/slack/webhook"
rpcUrl: "https://eth.llamarpc.com"
explorerUrl: "https://etherscan.io/"
intervalInSecs: 600

**Note:** The pre-built Docker image can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/chainsafeinfra/wallet-checker/general)
1. Build the Docker image:

    ```sh
    docker build -t wallet-checker .
    ```
2. Create and update the `config.yaml` file:
    ```sh
    cp sample-config.yaml config.yaml
    nano config.yaml
    ```

3. Run the Docker container:
    ```sh
    docker run -d --name wallet-checker-container -v ./config.yaml:/app/config.yaml wallet-checker
    ```

### Running Locally

1. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    go mod download
    ```

2. Build the application:
    ```sh
    go build -o wallet-checker
    ```
3. Create and update the `config.yaml` file:
    ```sh
